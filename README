NAME
    CPAN::Mini::LatestDistVersion - Create a CPAN mirror with only the
    latest version of each distribution

SYNOPSIS
        use CPAN::Mini::LatestDistVersion;
    
        CPAN::Mini::LatestDistVersion->update_mirror(
          remote => "http://cpan.metacpan.org/",
          local  => "/usr/share/mirrors/cpan",
        );
    
        # or via minicpan
    
        minicpan -c CPAN::Mini::LatestDistVersion

DESCRIPTION
    CPAN::Mini uses the package index file ("02packages.details.txt.gz") to
    grab the distribution tarballs that map to a module in the index.
    Sometimes a newer version of a distribution is released which removes a
    module. Until it is deleted via PAUSE, that old distribution will remain
    in the index. This module attemps to filter those old distributions from
    the local mirror.

METHODS
  new( %options )
    Overridden method which adds a sub to "path_filters" which will reject
    any dists which do not match the latest version from the
    "02packages.details.txt.gz" index.

  mirror_indices( )
    Overridden method which parses "02packages.details.txt.gz" and
    constructs the list of the latest version of each distribution.
